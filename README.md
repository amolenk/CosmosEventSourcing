# Event Sourcing with Azure Cosmos DB

This repository contains an example of an Event Store built on Azure Cosmos DB.

It contains all demo code that I use in my Cosmos Event Sourcing talk. See [here](https://github.com/amolenk/CosmosEventSourcing/blob/master/Event%20Sourcing%20with%20Azure%20Cosmos%20DB.pdf) for the slidedeck.

The [mssql](https://github.com/amolenk/CosmosEventSourcing/tree/mssql) branch contains code to have views written to MSSQL (contributed by [marctalcott](https://github.com/marctalcott), thanks!)
